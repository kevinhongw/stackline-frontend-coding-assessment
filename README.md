# vite-template-redux

Uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), and [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) to create a modern [React](https://react.dev/) app compatible with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)

```sh
npx degit reduxjs/redux-templates/packages/vite-template-redux my-app
```

## Goals

- Easy migration from Create React App or Vite
- As beginner friendly as Create React App
- Optimized performance compared to Create React App
- Customizable without ejecting

## Scripts

- `dev`/`start` - start dev server and open browser
- `build` - build for production
- `preview` - locally preview production build
- `test` - launch test runner

## Inspiration

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/main/packages/cra-template)
- [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react)
- [Vitest](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/tree/main/examples/react-testing-lib)

Thank you for taking our web developer assessment. To complete the assessment, you will take what is provided and create a simple product web page that uses React to produce the view and Redux to manage the state.  It should take approximately 2 hours to complete a typical solution, but you may take up to 24 hours.  You may use any public npm packages.

 Resources to get started (attached via email):
A JSON file to be used as the data source to populate the web page
A wire mockup of what your final web page should look like.  You only need to implement the page with the graph and/or table.

We are looking for:
A solution that resembles the provided mockup closely and implements AT LEAST ONE of either the graph or table as seen in the mockup
A working solution that takes the provided JSON file as output from a mock API call
A solution that implements React and Redux best practices and patterns
Clean, easy to follow code

Nice to haves:
Typescript
Functional components
Additional functionality in the graph or table, e.g. sorting, overlays

Assets to be returned via email within the provided time frame:
A public git repository to view the final code
A public URL to view the web page --- can be hosted on GitHub Pages, AWS, Vercel, etc.
